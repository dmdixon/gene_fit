Helper functions of a genetic algorithm to systematically search a large parameter space and converge to a solution. Practically example is seen in 

Application for a best-fit PHOEBE eclipsing binary model is described in [this paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..187C/abstract).

Separate solver object for any general model coming soon!
